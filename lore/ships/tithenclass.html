      <p>The Tithen Class Airship was a small ship used by the Alliance, mainly for supply missions. The ship was developed by the Alliance, for being cheap and expendable, this allowed them to be used in risky supply missions, primarily to the kingdom of Ewoikio, which hadn't fallen to the Invaders. The ship had zero ships, and could only be defended by archers, and thus wasn't used in fleets.</p>
