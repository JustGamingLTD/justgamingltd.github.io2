			<h1>PVAI-Lore-Ships-Raider Class Airship</h1>
			


			<p>The Raider Class Airship was the main airship class of both the Invaders and the Alliance. The old kingdoms used this class of ship years before the Invasion, but most of them were destroyed during it. The few that weren't destroyed, either joined the Alliance, or were reverse-engineered by the Invaders, and made more of them, while the Alliance also built more of them. The ship had four cannons, which made the ship small enough for the hit-and-run tactics, while staying big enough for fighting in fleets.</p>
