			<h1>PVAI-Lore-Battles-The Battle of the Fates (Air Attack)</h1>
			


			<p>After the Battle of Ewoikio, the invaders knew that the Alliance was stronger then they had expected it to be, they, however, still didn't know the location of their base. One thing they could do, was to use their air force to raid the Alliance's, that was bringing troops to their missions. These raids crippled the Alliance's air force, and their missions with it. So, in order to finally be able to complete some missions, they dispatched all their Raider Class Airships in an all-out battle. The Alliance was almost defeated, when Elytra Wing Strike Force, a squad specialized in aerial combat, flew to the Black Dragon, the flagship of RAGTHERBOS, and killed its commander, throwing the Invader's fleet into chaos. With this chaos, the enemy ships were destroyed or fled.</p>
