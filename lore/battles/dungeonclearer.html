			<h1>PVAI-Lore-Battles-The Batle of the Quandinium Mob Spawners (Dungeon Clearer)</h1>
			


			<p>Five weeks after the Invasion, the Alliance mounted their first attack. Not to retake anything however, because it was a strike to destroy one of the main monster spawners of the Invaders, lying in Quandinium. This was done in order to limit the amount of troops defending any single location, so it would be easier to take them. A team of three soldiers were dispatched to destroy the monster spawners, in the Battle of the Quandinium Mob Spawners, codenamed Dungeon Clearer. Although the Invaders now knew there was a resistance against them, they didn't know anything else about them, not their size, not their base locations nor anything else.</p>
