			<h1>PVAI-Lore-Battles-The Battle of Othrond Pendoliae (Castle Siege)</h1>
			


			<p>Five months after the Invasion, it was time for the Alliance to capture their first city. A task force was sent to capture the city. The battle started off well, and the task force killed the guards in the city. They tried to capture the castle after this, and succeeded by suposedly killing RAGTHERION, but it was a trap and RAGTHERION had actually managed to flee. Skeleton warriors were sent by RAGPHOBOS and besieged the castle, but it was easily broken because it hadn't been set up properly yet, but there were vindicators underway to re-besiege the castle, under command of RAGPHOBOS himself. RAGPHOBOS and the vindicators were all killed by the task force, and control was established over Othrond Pendoliae.
