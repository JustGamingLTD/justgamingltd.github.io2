			<h1>PVAI - Lore - History - Aquania</h1>
			


      <h3><b>Summary</b></h3>
      <p>Aquania is one of the two major powers on the continent of Siniath Dór.</p>
			<h3><b>Location</b></h3>
      <p>The kingdom of Aquania lies in the south of Siniath Dór, the continent that would later be invaded by the Invaders. It shares a border with Leolia, marked by a river. This led to them having a major advantage in any war, because it would be almost imposible to be invaded, and the likely invasion would have to be through the neutral Leolia. This led them to become one of the most powerful kingdoms in Siniath Dór.</p>
      <h3><b>Politics</b></h3>
      <p>Aquania had an alliance with Pendolia, after it formed during a civil war. It later approached the formerly neutral kingdom of Leolia, but this wouldn't be allowed by Heraklion, the other major power. Heraklion threatened to invade Leolia in the case an alliance was formed, but this would never happend due to the Invasion, which had happened just after the proposal.</p>
      <h3><b>History</b></h3>
      <p>Aquania had formed even before any event was ever recorded. It's first known war was a war with Heraklion, which resulted in a stalemate</p>
