      <h3><b>Summary</b></h3>
      <p>Quandinium is one of the minor powers on the continent of Siniath Dór. It has a huge amount of land, but does not have many inhabitants.</p>
			<h3><b>Location</b></h3>
      <p>The kingdom of Quandinium lies in the north of Siniath Dór, the continent that would later be invaded by the Invaders. It shares a border with Heraklion and Pendolia, both marked by mountains. The mountains protected it from both Heraklion and Aquania. The territory is largely uninhabited, except for a few cities to the south.</p>
      <h3><b>Politics</b></h3>
      <p>Quandinium was a semi-neutral nation. It hasn't ever fought in a major war, but it did send some volunteers to Pendolia in its civil war and guaranteed the independence of Leolia, making sure a land war between Heraklion and Aquania never erupted.</p>
      <h3><b>History</b></h3>
      <p>Quandinium started of as an extremely small kingdom, but it quickly conquered the neighboring tribes, assimilating them into the growing kingdom. Seventy years before the Invasion, it was invited into Aquania's faction, but refused, fearing a war between them and Heraklion.</p>
