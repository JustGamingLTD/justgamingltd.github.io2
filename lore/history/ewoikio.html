      <h3><b>Summary</b></h3>
      <p>Ewoikio is a minor power on an island near the continent of Siniath Dór. It is an isolated nation that remains quite undeveloped.</p>
			<h3><b>Location</b></h3>
      <p>The kingdom of Ewoikio lies on an island near Siniath Dór, the continent that would later be invaded by the Invaders. Because it is an island nation, it remained isolated far longer than any other nation on Siniath Dór, and was never invaded. It, however, remained undeveloped, even until the Invasion.</p>
      <h3><b>Politics</b></h3>
      <p>Pendolia was a nation alligned with Aquania, and was hostile towards Mesepotanum, because they both coveted each others land.</p>
      <h3><b>History</b></h3>
      <p>Pendolia was formerly part of the kingdom of Osroes, but seceded together with Mesepotanum. It conquered large parts of Osroes while also fighting Mesepotanum. They fought each other for 20 jears, before finally making peace with Mesepotanum, deviding the land about equally. They were approached by Aquania for an alliance, and reluctantly accepted it, hoping it would protect them from Heraklion and Mesepotanum.</p>
