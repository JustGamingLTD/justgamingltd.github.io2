			<h1>PVAI - Lore - History - Heraklion</h1>
			


      <h3><b>Summary</b></h3>
      <p>Heraklion is one of the two major powers on the continent of Siniath Dór.</p>
			<h3><b>Location</b></h3>
      <p>The kingdom of Herkalion lies in the middle of Siniath Dór, the continent that would later be invaded by the Invaders. It shares a border with Leolia, marked by a river, Pendolia and Mesepotanum, both marked by mountains. The mountians protected them from both Pendolia and Mesepotanum, and the neutral Leolia protected them from Aquania.</p>
      <h3><b>Politics</b></h3>
      <p>Heraklion had an alliance with Mesepotanum and Ewoikio. It later threatened the formerly neutral kingdom of Leolia, which had been approached by Aquania for an alliance, and it mobilised its army, but this would never happen due to the Invasion, which happened just after the proposal.</p>
      <h3><b>History</b></h3>
      <p>Herkalion had formed even before any event was ever recorded. It's first known war was a war with Aquania, which resulted in a stalemate, and a peace treaty was signed after five years. A few wars with Heraklion were fought, but all of them resulted in a stalemate. Aquania later helped Pendolia form during a civil war with Mesepotanum, and formed an alliance with them, this would help with invading any other nation. Aquania approached Leolia to join their alliance just before the Invasion, which caused relations with Heraklion to worsen once more, but a war didn't start due to the Invasion.</p>
