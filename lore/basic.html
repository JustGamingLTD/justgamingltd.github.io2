			<h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
			<p>Before the Invasion, there were seven kingdoms, Ewoikio, Aquania, Heraklion, Leolia, Pendolia, Quandinum and Mesepotanum. There were many wars and complex relations between them. Heraklion and Aquania were the major powers, and although relations had impoved over the last years, they were getting worse due to a conflict over a Leolia's allegiance. Both powers were preparing for war when the Invasion happened.</p>
			<h3><b>The Invasion</b></h3>
			<p>It happened unexpectedly, almost everone was asleep, and then, most people woke up from a rumble. The noise was similar to an earthquake, because the event was similar to an earthquake. A huge rift formed inside and between the kingdoms, killing everyone above it. Most kingdoms, luckily, had an emergency plan for events like this. They were able to evacuate their kings, but at huge cost, more than 80% of the soldiers were killed or vanished. The rest fled to the outskirts of their kingdoms. Only a few stayed with their kings.</p>
