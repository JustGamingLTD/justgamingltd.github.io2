			<h1>PVAI-Lore-Basic History</h1>
			



			<h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
			<p>Before the Invasion, there were seven kingdoms, Ewoikio, Aquania, Heraklion, Leolia, Pendolia, Quandinum and Mesepotanum. There were many wars between them with complex relations between them. Heraklion and Aquania were the major powers, and although relations had impoved over the last years, they were getting worse due to a conflict over a Leolia's allegiance. Both powers were preparing for war when the Invasion happened.</p>
