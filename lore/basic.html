			<h1>PVAI-Lore-Basic History</h1>
			



			<h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
			<p>Before the Invasion, there were seven kingdoms, Ewoikio, Aquania, Heraklion, Leolia, Pendolia, Quandinum and Mesepotanum. There were many wars and complex relations between them. Heraklion and Aquania were the major powers, and although relations had impoved over the last years, they were getting worse due to a conflict over a Leolia's allegiance. Both powers were preparing for war when the Invasion happened.</p>
			<h3><b>The Invasion</b></h3>
			<p>It happened unexpectedly, almost everone was asleep, and then, most people woke up from a rumble. The noise was similar to an earthquake, because the event was similar to an earthquake. A huge rift formed inside and between the kingdoms, killing everyone above it. Most kingdoms, luckily, had an emergency plan for events like this. They were able to evacuate their kings, but at huge cost, more than 80% of the soldiers were killed or vanished. The rest fled to the outskirts of their kingdoms. Only a few stayed with their kings. How did most of the soldiers die you ask? From the rift came monsters, hundreds of them, and although they were weak, their sheer numbers were able to easily overwhelm anyone trying to fight them. They came from the underworld, and had prepared this Invasion for many years. They managed to take control of every kingdom, except Ewoikio, which hadn't been damaged by the rift as much as the other kingdoms. The Invasion had begun.</p>
			<h3><b>The Alliance</b></h3>
			<p>The kings fled with their personal guard, to the only place they figured to be safe, the mountain of Emmerium. It had been left alone by every kingdom, in the knowledge that it would be in everyone's best interest, to use it as a place only to be used in the most dire of emergencies. The journey was harsh due to the airships being destroyed by the rift and the invaders. So the kings walked, some of them, like the king of Aquania, called J_LTD, met up with other kings during their travels. J_LTD, for example, met up with Cube_nl, king of Pendolia, discussing the formation of an Alliance to push back the invaders. Once they were at the summit of Emmerium, all the kings decided to set their differences asside, to unite in an Alliance, The Alliance to push back the Invaders. It was decided that J_LTD and Kian, king of Heraklion, would go to Ewoikio, in order to recruit its king, MrStr00pwafel, to their cause. EDG500, king of Quandinum, and Leolas would be in charge of building a base of operations, and DaanLBoyNl, king of Mesepotanum would be in charge of finding and recruiting new soldiers. A base was built in a few weeks, and MrStr00pwafel was recruited, although they he refused to move out of Ewoikio, and more than twenty men were recruited to the Alliance in the first week, with ten more in the second. A resistance was beginning to form.</p>
