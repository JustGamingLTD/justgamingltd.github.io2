			<h1>PVAI-Lore-Basic History</h1>
			



			<h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
			<p>Before the Invasion, there were seven kingdoms, Ewoikio, Aquania, Heraklion, Leolia, Pendolia, Quandinum and Mesepotanum. There were many wars and complex relations between them. Heraklion and Aquania were the major powers, and although relations had impoved over the last years, they were getting worse due to a conflict over a Leolia's allegiance. Both powers were preparing for war when the Invasion happened.</p>
			<h3><b>The Invasion</b></h3>
			<p>It happened unexpectedly, almost everone was asleep, and then, most people woke up from a rumble. The noise was similar to an earthquake, because the event was similar to an earthquake. A huge rift formed inside and between the kingdoms, killing everyone above it. Most kingdoms, luckily, had an emergency plan for events like this. They were able to evacuate their kings, but at huge cost, more than 80% of the soldiers were killed or vanished. The rest fled to the outskirts of their kingdoms. Only a few stayed with their kings. How did most of the soldiers die you ask? From the rift came monsters, hundreds of them, and although they were weak, their sheer numbers were able to easily overwhelm anyone trying to fight them. They came from the underworld, and had prepared this Invasion for many years. They managed to take control of every kingdom, except Ewoikio, which hadn't been damaged by the rift as much as the other kingdoms. The Invasion had begun.</p>
