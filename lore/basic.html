			<h1>PVAI-Lore-Basic History</h1>
			



			<h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
			<p>Before the Invasion, there were seven kingdoms, Ewoikio, Aquania, Heraklion, Leolia, Pendolia, Quandinium and Mesepotanum. There were many wars and complex relations between them. Heraklion and Aquania were the major powers, and although relations had impoved over the last years, they were getting worse due to a conflict over Pendolia's allegiance. Both powers were preparing for war when the Invasion happened.</p>
			<h3><b>The Invasion</b></h3>
			<p>It happened unexpectedly, almost everone was asleep, and then, most people woke up from a rumble. The noise was similar to an earthquake, because the event was similar to an earthquake. A huge rift formed inside and between the kingdoms, killing everyone above it. Most kingdoms, luckily, had an emergency plan for events like this. They were able to evacuate their kings, but at huge cost, more than 80% of the soldiers were killed or vanished. The rest fled to the outskirts of their kingdoms. Only a few stayed with their kings. How did most of the soldiers die you ask? From the rift came monsters, hundreds of them, and although they were weak, their sheer numbers were able to easily overwhelm anyone trying to fight them. They came from the underworld, and had prepared this Invasion for many years. They managed to take control of every kingdom, except Ewoikio, which hadn't been damaged by the rift as much as the other kingdoms. The Invasion had begun.</p>
			<h3>The Alliance</h3>
			<p>The kings fled with their personal guard, to the only place they figured to be safe, the mountain of Emmerium. It had been left alone by every kingdom, in the knowledge that it would be in everyone's best interest, to use it as a place only to be used in the most dire of emergencies. The journey was harsh due to the airships being destroyed by the rift and the invaders. So the kings walked. Some of them, like the king of Aquania, called J_LTD, met up with other kings during their travels. J_LTD, for example, met up with Cube_nl, king of Pendolia, discussing the formation of an Alliance to push back the invaders. Once they were at the summit of Emmerium, all the kings decided to set their differences asside, to unite in an Alliance, The Alliance to push back the Invaders. It was decided that J_LTD and Kian, king of Heraklion, would go to Ewoikio, in order to recruit its king, MrStr00pwafel, to their cause. EDG500, king of Quandinium, and Leolas would be in charge of building a base of operations, and DaanLBoyNl, king of Mesepotanum would be in charge of finding and recruiting new soldiers. A base was built in a few weeks, and MrStr00pwafel was recruited, although they he refused to move out of Ewoikio, and more than twenty men were recruited to the Alliance in the first week, with ten more in the second. A resistance was beginning to form.</p>
			<h3>Gathering Strength</h3>
			<p>After the Alliance formed, they were still very weak. Even though there were more than seventy people, the Invaders outnumbered them by many orders of magnitude. Weeks passed without the Invaders discovering the Alliance, and the Alliance used this advantage to build a fleet of Raider Class Airships. They mined for recources, set up defences, recruited more men and crafted gear. Finally, after three weeks, they were ready for their first attack.</p>
			<h3>Important Battles</h3>
			<h4>The Batle of the Quandinium Mob Spawners (Dungeon Clearer)</h4>
			<p>Five weeks after the Invasion, the Alliance mounted their first attack. Not to retake anything however, because it was a strike to destroy one of the main monster spawners of the Invaders, lying in Quandinium. This was done in order to limit the amount of troops defending any single location, so it would be easier to take them. A team of three soldiers were dispatched to destroy the monster spawners, in the Battle of the Quandinium Mob Spawners, codenamed Dungeon Clearer. Although the Invaders now knew there was a resistance against them, they didn't know anything else about them, not their size, not their base locations nor anything else.</p>
			<h4>The Battle of Ewoikio (Castle Defend)</h4>
			<p>Eleven days later, the Invaders launched an assault on the kingdom of Ewoikio, which had survived up until that point. The Alliance decided to send a few of their most elite soldiers, to help defending Ewoikio. The Invaders started by launching skeleton archers and infantry zombies, but didn't realize that the Alliance's soldiers were present, they managed to push back the Invaders' first wave of soldier, and the Invaders sent even more men, including their commander, RAGTHEKIOS. Again, however, due to the extensive training of these Alliance's soldiers, they were pushed back, and RAGTHEKIOS was killed.</p>
			<h4>The Battle of the Fates (Air Attack)</h4>
			<p>After the Battle of Ewoikio, the invaders knew that the Alliance was stronger then they had expected it to be, they, however, still didn't know the location of their base. One thing they could do, was to use their air force to raid the Alliance's, that was bringing troops to their missions. These raids crippled the Alliance's air force, and their missions with it. So, in order to finally be able to complete some missions, they dispatched all their Raider Class Airships in an all-out battle. The Alliance was almost defeated, when Elytra Wing Strike Force, a squad specialized in aerial combat, flew to the Black Dragon, the flagship of RAGTHERBOS, and killed its commander, throwing the Invader's fleet into chaos. With this chaos, the enemy ships were destroyed or fled.</p>
			<h4>The Battle of Othrond Pendoliae (Castle Siege)</h4>
			<p>Five months after the Invasion, it was time for the Alliance to capture their first city. A task force was sent to capture the city. The battle started off well, and the task force killed the guards in the city. They tried to capture the castle after this, and succeeded by suposedly killing RAGTHERION, but it was a trap and RAGTHERION had actually managed to flee. Skeleton warriors were sent by RAGPHOBOS and besieged the castle, but it was easily broken because it hadn't been set up properly yet, but there were vindicators underway to re-besiege the castle, under command of RAGPHOBOS himself. RAGPHOBOS and the vindicators were all killed by the task force, and control was established over Othrond Pendoliae.</p>
