			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Engage in epic battles to destroy the opponents' ship, while defending that of your own team. Determine your tactic, will you overpower the other ship with your ship's turrets, will you take control of the opponents' ship or will you blow up the other ship from within? Be wary though, because your opponents might board your ship to blow it up.</p>
