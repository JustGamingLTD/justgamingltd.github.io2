Hello Beta Testers,

We are ecxited to announce that our fourth map, Castle Siege, is almost finished. This is the final map we are looking to complete before releasing our server. We hope that the map will be finished within a couple of weeks. After this, we are going to polish the maps, spawn and website. We also need to create ranks, before our server will finally be ready, but that is the final thing we need to do before releasing the server. We can release the server after this. Hope you have fun!

Cheers, J_LTD
